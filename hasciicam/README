Hasciicam makes it possible to have live ascii video on the web. It
captures video from a tv card and renders it into ascii, formatting the
output into an html page with a refresh tag or in a live ascii window or
in a simple text file as well, giving the possiblity to anybody that has a
bttv card. a linux box and a cheap modem line to show a live asciivideo
feed that can be browsable without any need for plugin, java etc.

---

INSTALLATION

it should work as usual:
./configure
make
make install

what's needed to compile:

aalib - that's the great lib that makes possible ascii rendering
	if your distribution does'nt includes it, you can fetch it
	from the hasciicam webpage.

video4linux driver - depending on your card - stable comes as a kernel module
		bttv :: http://www.metzlerbros.de/bttv.html
		buz :: http://www.munich-vision.de/buz
		usb cams :: http://www.linux-usb.org

i'm using hasciicam with a wintv hauppage card (bttv brooktree)
using as a driver the bttv one coming with the 2.4.x kernel series

i also had success with logitech/dexxa usb cams, using the mod_quickcam
module available at http://qce-ga.sf.net

people reported success with several pci and usb devices, refer to
video4linux documentation for further informations

at the moment hasciicam DOES NOT WORKS with PHILIPS WEBCAMS (and any
other webcam using the pwc driver). help is needed with YUV420P
grabbing to make it work - mail jaromil /@/ dyne.org for suggestions.

DOCUMENTATION

to have a list of command line options:
./hasciicam -h
or once installed try:
man hasciicam
