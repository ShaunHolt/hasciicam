                [ (h)ascii for the masses! ]
                              version 1.0 codename ASCII ROOTS 

Hasciicam makes it possible to have live ascii video on the web. It
captures video from a tv card and renders it into ascii, formatting the
output into an html page with a refresh tag or in a live ascii window or
in a simple text file as well, giving the possiblity to anybody that has a
bttv card. a linux box and a cheap modem line to show a live asciivideo
feed that can be browsable without any need for plugin, java etc.
